Data Science project in predicting sports game score

Project 4 - Major Leagues

In this project we are trying to predict the score of a sports match with data science and machine learning. Data comes from: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/soccer-spi

Findings/Results:

I was very happy with the results of this project. At first I started with a just a simple Linear Regression model. But then after some thought, I changed the model to include a feature from a classifier model. The percentage correct of identifying the exact point total of the match was 5%, but after adding the classifying model, I increased the perecntage correct of identifying the correct score to around 40%. The percentage correct for the classifying model that classifies if the match was a win/lose/draw was around 80%. The jupyter notebook has all of my code and notes on the process of getting to the endpoint. If I were to do this project again, I would take more time so as to be able to train it on the much larger dataset, I would try and use a Neural Network and see how that fairs with this task, and I would also use the rank of the team. By doing all of those, I believe that I would get a better estimation of the score of the teams.
